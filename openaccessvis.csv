Janiga, H.-C. Hege, S. Zachow, B. Preim",,"Simulations and measurements of blood and air flow inside the human circulatory and respiratory system play an increasingly important role in personalized medicine for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. This survey focuses on three main application areas. (1) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow in cerebral aneurysms assist in predicting the outcome of this pathologic process and of therapeutic interventions. (2) CFD simulations of nasal airflow allow for investigating the effects of obstructions and deformities and provide therapy decision support. (3) 4D Phase-Contrast (4D PC) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of aortic hemodynamics supports the diagnosis of various vascular and valve pathologies as well as their treatment. An investigation of the complex and often dynamic simulation and measurement data requires the coupling of sophisticated visualization, interaction, and data analysis techniques. In this paper, we survey the large body of work that has been conducted within this realm. We extend previous surveys by incorporating nasal airflow, addressing the joint investigation of blood flow and vessel wall properties, and providing a more fine-granular taxonomy of the existing techniques. From the survey, we extract major research trends and identify open problems and future challenges. The survey is intended for researchers interested in medical flow but also more general, in the combined visualization of physiology and anatomy, the extraction of features from flow field data and feature-based visualization, the visual comparison of different simulation results, and the interactive visual analysis of the flow field and derived characteristics.",,,,,10.1111/cgf.13394,2018,2018,star,Room 3+4,Wednesday,STAR II: FlowVis,11:10 AM,12:00 PM,
STAR (CGF),,The State of the Art in Vortex Extraction," T. Guenther, H. Theisel",https://cgl.ethz.ch/disclaimer.php?dlurl=/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2018/Gun18a/Gun18a.pdf,"Vortices are commonly understood as rotating motions in fluid flows. The analysis of vortices plays an important role in numerous scientific applications, such as in engineering, meteorology, oceanology, medicine and many more. The successful analysis consists of three steps: vortex definition, extraction and visualization. All three have a long history, and the early themes and topics from the 70s survived to this day, namely the identification of vortex cores, their extent and the choice of suitable reference frames. This paper provides an overview over the advances that have been made in the last forty years. We provide sufficient background on differential vector field calculus, extraction techniques like critical point search and the parallel vectors operator, and we introduce the notion of reference frame invariance. We explain the most important region-based and line-based methods, integration-based and geometry-based approaches, recent objective techniques, the selection of reference frames by means of flow decompositions, as well as a recent local optimization-based technique. We point out relationships between the various approaches, classify the literature and identify open problems and challenges for future work.",,,,,10.1111/cgf.13319,2018,2018,star,Room 3+4,Wednesday,STAR II: FlowVis,12:00 PM,12:50 PM,

A common visualization approach is to facilitate parameterization techniques which flatten a usually 3D object into a 2D plane. Within this state of the art report (STAR), we review such techniques used in medical visualization and investigate how they can be classified with respect to the handled data and the underlying tasks. Many of these techniques are inspired by mesh parameterization algorithms which help to project a triangulation in R^3 to a simpler domain in R^2. It is often claimed that this makes complex structures easier to understand and compare by humans and machines. Within this STAR we review such flattening techniques which have been developed for the analysis of the following medical entities: the circulation system, the colon, the brain, tumors, and bones. For each of these five application scenarios, we have analyzed the tasks and requirements, and classified the reviewed techniques with respect to a developed coding system. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the future development of flattening techniques in these areas",,,,,,,2018,star,Room 3+4,Wednesday,"STAR III: Visualizing 3D Objects

Gomes",,"Detecting and analysing protein cavities provides significant information about active sites for biological processes (e.g. protein–protein or protein–ligand binding) in molecular graphics and modelling. Using the three‐dimensional (3D) structure of a given protein (i.e. atom types and their locations in 3D) as retrieved from a PDB (Protein Data Bank) file, it is now computationally viable to determine a description of these cavities. Such cavities correspond to pockets, clefts, invaginations, voids, tunnels, channels and grooves on the surface of a given protein. In this work, we survey the literature on protein cavity computation and classify algorithmic approaches into three categories: evolution‐based, energy‐based and geometry‐based. Our survey focuses on geometric algorithms, whose taxonomy is extended to include not only sphere‐, grid‐ and tessellation‐based methods, but also surface‐based, hybrid geometric, consensus and time‐varying methods. Finally, we detail those techniques that have been customized for GPU (graphics processing unit) computing.

It is most often used to lower I/O and storage costs, and sometimes to lower in‐memory data size as well. With this paper, we consider five categories of data reduction techniques based on their information loss: (1) truly lossless, (2) near lossless, (3) lossy, (4) mesh reduction and (5) derived representations. We then survey available techniques in each of these categories, summarize their properties from a practical point of view and discuss relative merits within a category. We believe, in total, this work will enable simulation scientists and visualization/data analysis scientists to decide which data reduction techniques will be most helpful for their needs.",,,,,10.1111/cgf.13336,2018,2018,star,Room 3+4,Thursday,STAR IV: Dealing with Scale,12:00 PM,12:50 PM,

Cappers, Huub van de Wetering",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324719902_Visual_Analysis_of_Parallel_Interval_Events,"System logs typically contain lines with time stamps that each describes an event. Where these events semantically form start and end events, they can be combined into interval events. For visual event analytics, the analysis of interval events is more complex than that of point events, since not only the order of events, but also temporal overlaps have to be taken into account. To address this increased complexity and for the purpose of system understanding and analysis, we present SELE, a domain-independent tool for visualizing parallel interval events. SELE is intended to be used on a single long trace of events. A visual technique named strata timeline is developed to handle visual scalability issues. Finally, a multi-core parallel graph searching algorithm is analyzed to demonstrate SELE.

We describe a framework that takes text containing markup, a related dataset, and a configuration file as inputs and produces an interactive document. The resulting document provides interactions such as details on demand, visual highlighting and comparison, and bushing-and-linking. In addition to regular sized graphics, the use of word-sized graphics or sparklines presents related content in view-focus of the reader.

Twenty-three participants, in a lab study, were shown two interactive financial portfolio optimization interfaces which allowed them to adjust the return for the portfolio and view how the risk changes. One interface showed the sensitivity of the risk to changes in the return and one did not have this feature. Our study highlights two classes of users. One which preferred the interface with the sensitivity feature and one group that does not prefer the sensitivity feature. We named these two groups the ``risk fixers'' and the ``sweet spotters'' due to the analysis method they used. The ``risk fixers'' selected a level of risk which they were comfortable with while the ``sweet spotters'' tried to find a point right before the risk increased greatly. Our study shows that exposing the sensitivity of investment parameters will impact the investment decision process and increase confidence for these ``sweet spotters.'' We also discuss the implications for design.",,,,,,,2018,"short

In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group-by’s at multiple temporal hierarchies. Effective visual analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP cube-based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space-efficient cube data structures allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re-computed whenever there is new data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise Profiler, a web-based visualization framework that supports the analysis of noise from cities.

Viewing online reviews, including the rating score and text comments by other customers, and conducting a comparison between different businesses are the key to making an optimal decision. However, due to the massive amount of online reviews, the potential difference of user rating standards, and the significant variance of review time, length, details and quality, it is difficult for customers to achieve a quick and comprehensive comparison. In this paper, we present E-Comp, a carefully-designed visual analytics system based on online reviews, to help customers compare local businesses at different levels of details. More specifically, intuitive glyphs overlaid on maps are designed for quick candidate selection. Grouped Sankey diagram visualizing the rating difference by common customers is chosen for more reliable comparison of two businesses.

Visual-interactive labeling (VIAL) provides users an active role in the process of labeling, with the goal to combine the potentials of humans and machines to make labeling more efficient. Recent experiments showed that users apply different strategies when selecting instances for labeling with visual-interactive interfaces. In this paper, we contribute a systematic quantitative analysis of such user strategies. We identify computational building blocks of user strategies, formalize them, and investigate their potentials for different machine learning tasks in systematic experiments. The core insights of our experiments are as follows. First, we identified that particular user strategies can be used to considerably mitigate the bootstrap (cold start) problem in early labeling phases. Second, we observed that they have the potential to outperform existing active learning strategies in later phases. Third, we analyzed the identified core building blocks, which can serve as the basis for novel selection strategies. Overall, we observed that data-based user strategies (clusters, dense areas) work considerably well in early phases, while model-based user strategies (e.g., class separation) perform better during later phases. The insights gained from this work can be applied to develop novel active learning approaches as well as to better guide users in visual interactive labeling.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Tuesday,FP III: High-dimensional Data,5:20 PM,5:45 PM,

Designers face a number of design and implementation choices when using summarization in visual analytics systems. While these choices influence the utility of the resulting system, there are no clear guidelines for the use of these summarization techniques. In this paper, we codify summarization use in existing systems to identify key factors in the design of summary visualizations. We use quantitative content analysis to systematically survey examples of visual analytics systems and enumerate the use of these design factors in data summarization. Through this analysis, we expose the relationship between design considerations, strategies for data summarization in visualization systems, and how different summarization methods influence the analyses supported by systems. We use these results to synthesize common patterns in real-world use of summary visualizations and highlight open challenges and opportunities that these patterns offer for designing effective systems.

To better assess these effects and create refined rankings of visual encodings, we conduct an experiment measuring subject performance across task types (e.g., comparing individual versus aggregate values) and data distributions (e.g., with varied cardinalities and entropies). We compare performance across 12 encoding specifications of trivariate data involving 1 categorical and 2 quantitative fields, including the use of x, y, color, size, and spatial subdivision (i.e., faceting). Our results extend existing models of encoding effectiveness and suggest improved approaches for automated design.

While graph layout algorithms have focused on minimizing edge crossing, symmetry, and other such layout properties, there is not much known about how these algorithms relate to a user’s ability to perceive graph properties for a given graph layout. In this study, we apply previously established methodologies for perceptual analysis to identify which graph drawing layout will help the user best perceive a particular graph property. We conduct a large scale (n = 588 ) crowdsourced experiment to investigate whether the perception of two graph properties (graph density and average local clustering coefficient) can be modeled using Weber’s law. We study three graph layout algorithms from three representative classes (Force Directed - FD, Circular, and Multi-Dimensional Scaling - MDS), and the results of this experiment establish the precision of judgment for these graph layouts and properties. Our findings demonstrate that the perception of graph density can be modeled with Weber’s law. Furthermore, the perception of the average clustering coefficient can be modeled as an inverse of Weber’s law, and the MDS layout showed a significantly different precision of judgment than the FD layout.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Wednesday,FP IV: Visualization Design,10:15 AM,10:40 AM,

From an extensive literature study, we find that the existing solutions suffer from at least one of the drawbacks below: (i) loss of interesting structures/outliers due to sampling; (ii) supporting heatmaps only, which provides limited information; and (iii) no notion of real-world geography semantics (e.g., country, state, city) is captured in the visualization result as well as the underlying index. Therefore, we propose ConcaveCubes, a cluster-based data cube to support interactive visualization of large-scale multidimensional urban data. Specifically, we devise an appropriate visualization abstraction and visualization design based on clusters. We propose a novel concave hull construction method to support boundary based cluster map vi-sualization, where real-world geographical semantics are preserved without any information loss. Instead of calculating the clusters on demand, ConcaveCubes (re)utilizes existing calculation and visualization results to efficiently support different kinds of user interactions. We conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets and show the efficiency and effectiveness of ConcaveCubes by comparing with the state-of-the-art cube-based solutions.

Often, slices are generated by using a parametric form and then constraining parameters to view the slice. In our case, we developed an algorithm to slice a simplical mesh of any number of dimensions with a two-dimensional slice. In order to get a global appreciation of the multi-dimensional object, we show multiple slices by sampling a number of different slicing points and projecting the slices into a single view per dimension pair. These slices are shown in an interactive viewer which can switch between a global view (all slices) and a local view (single slice). We show how this method can be used to study regular polytopes, differences between spaces of polynomials, and multi-objective optimization surfaces.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Wednesday,FP VI: Structure and Shape,11:35 AM,12:00 PM,

Thiagarajan, Shusen Liu, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Peer-Timo Bremer",https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07106?context=cs,"Two-dimensional embeddings remain the dominant approach to visualize high dimensional data. The choice of embeddings ranges from highly non-linear ones, which can capture complex relationships but are difficult to interpret quantitatively, to axis-aligned projections, which are easy to interpret but are limited to bivariate relationships. Linear project can be considered as a compromise between complexity and interpretability, as they allow explicit axes labels, yet provide significantly more degrees of freedom compared to axis-aligned projections. Nevertheless, interpreting the axes directions, which are linear combinations often with many non-trivial components, remains difficult. To address this problem we introduce a structure aware decomposition of (multiple) linear projections into sparse sets of axis aligned projections, which jointly capture all information of the original linear ones. In particular, we use tools from Dempster-Shafer theory to formally define how relevant a given axis aligned project is to explain the neighborhood relations displayed in some linear projection. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to discover a diverse set of high quality linear projections and show that in practice the information of k linear projections is often jointly encoded in \sim k axis aligned plots. We have integrated these ideas into an interactive visualization system that allows users to jointly browse both linear projections and their axis aligned representatives. Using a number of case studies we show how the resulting plots lead to more intuitive visualizations and new insight. ",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Wednesday,FP VI: Structure and Shape,12:00 PM,12:25 PM,

In turbulent combustion research, the behavior of the flame surface contains important information about the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The extraction and tracking of this surface is crucial for understanding combustion processes. This is impossible to realize as a post-process because of the size of the involved datasets, which are too large to be stored on disk. We present an on-the-fly method for tracking the flame surface directly during simulation and computing the local tangential surface deformation for arbitrary time intervals. In a massively parallel simulation, the data is distributed over many processes and only a single time step is in memory at any time. To satisfy the demands on parallelism and accuracy posed by this situation, we track the surface with independent micro-patches and adapt their distribution as needed to maintain numerical stability. With our method, we enable combustion researchers to observe the detailed movement and deformation of the flame surface over extended periods of time and thus gain novel insights into the mechanisms of turbulence-chemistry interactions.

Thus, we present the LloydRelaxer : a tool to minimize scaling-based effects in Star Coordinates. Our algorithm enforces a scaling configuration for which the data explains the observed patterns better than any scaling of them could do.

Applications range from components in natural language processing systems to tools for linguistic analysis in the study of language and literature. In many of these applications, interpreting embeddings and understanding the encoded grammatical and semantic relations between words is useful, but challenging. Visualization can aid in such interpretation of embeddings. In this paper, we examine the role for visualization in working with word vector embeddings. We provide a literature survey to catalogue the range of tasks where the embeddings are employed across a broad range of applications.

Motivated by such an observation and directly considering pixel coordinates in an embedding optimization process, we accelerate Barnes-Hut tree-based t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (BH-SNE), known as a state-of-the-art 2D embedding method, and propose a novel method called PixelSNE, a highly-efficient, screen resolution-driven 2D embedding method with a linear computational complexity in terms of the number of data items.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

Vortex core lines in vector fields were defined by Sujudi and Haimes to be the locations where stream lines are parallel to an eigenvector of the Jacobian. We show that a similar criterion applied to the eigenvector trajectories of a tensor field yields structurally stable lines that we call tensor core lines . We provide a formal definition of these structures and examine their mathematical properties. We also present a numerical algorithm for extracting tensor core lines in piecewise linear tensor fields.

To detect activities, data scientists iteratively experiment with different classifiers before deciding which model to deploy. Effective reasoning about and comparison of alternative classifiers are crucial in successful model development. This is, however, inherently difficult in developing classifiers for sensor data, where the intricacy of long temporal sequences, high prediction frequency, and imprecise labeling make standard evaluation methods relatively ineffective and even misleading. We introduce Track Xplorer, an interactive visualization system to query, analyze, and compare the predictions of sensor-data classifiers. Track Xplorer enables users to interactively explore and compare the results of different classifiers, and assess their accuracy with respect to the ground-truth labels and video. Through integration with a version control system, Track Xplorer supports tracking of models and their parameters without additional workload on model developers. Track Xplorer also contributes an extensible algebra over track representations to filter, compose, and compare classification outputs, enabling users to reason effectively about classifier performance. We apply Track Xplorer in a collaborative project to develop classifiers to detect movements from multisensor data gathered from Parkinson’s disease patients.

The purpose of the model may be to understand, to forecast or to control this piece of reality. Based on this model‐building perspective, we propose a detailed conceptual framework in which the visual analytics process is considered as a goal‐oriented workflow producing a model as a result. We demonstrate how this framework can be used for performing an analytical survey of the visual analytics research field and identifying the directions and areas where further research is needed.

Our system retrieves GIS relevant to creating a physical model of a geospatial region and then addresses the two major limitations of affordable 3D printers, namely the limited number of materials and available printing volume. This is accomplished by separating features into distinct extruded layers and splitting large models into smaller pieces, allowing us to employs different methods for the visualization of different geospatial features, like vegetation and residential areas, in a 3D printing context.

A CFG is a directed graph representing possible execution paths in a program. CFGs are commonly visualized as node-link diagrams while traces are commonly viewed in raw text format. Visualizing and exploring CFGs and traces is challenging because of the complexity and specificity of the operations researchers perform. We present a design study where we collaborate with computer scientists researching dynamic binary analysis and compilation techniques. The research group primarily employs CFGs and traces to reason about and develop new algorithms for program optimization and parallelization. Through questionnaires, interviews, and a year-long observation, we analyzed their use of visualization, noting that the tasks they perform match common subroutines they employ in their techniques. Based on this task analysis, we designed CFGExplorer, a visual analytics system that supports computer scientists with interactions that are integrated with the program structure. We developed a domain-specific graph modification to generate graph layouts that reflect program structure. CFGExplorer incorporates structures such as functions and loops, and uses the correspondence between CFGs and traces to support navigation. We further augment the system to highlight the output of program analysis techniques, facilitating exploration at a higher level.

Users identify node sets based on data or graph properties and apply high-level constraints within each set.

Visualizations of bipartite graphs allow users to understand the mutual relationships between the elements in the two collections, e.g., by identifying clusters of similarly connected elements. However, commonly-used visual representations do not scale for the analysis of large bipartite graphs containing tens of millions of vertices, often resorting to an a-priori clustering of the sets. To address this issue, we present the Who’s-Active-On-What-Visualization (WAOW-Vis) that allows for multiscale exploration of a bipartite social-network without imposing an a-priori clustering. To this end, we propose to treat a bipartite graph as a high-dimensional space and we create the WAOW-Vis adapting the multiscale dimensionality-reduction technique HSNE.

We  report  on  the  design  process  of T REE S COPE ,  which  has  been  received  positively  by network researchers as well as system administrators. Through case studies of real and simulated data, we demonstrate how T REE S COPE ’s  visual  design  and  interactive  support  for  complex  queries  on  network  traffic  can  provide  experts  with  new insights into the occurrences and causes of congestion in the network.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Thursday,FP XIV: Trees and Graphs,5:20 PM,5:45 PM,

We conducted an eye-tracking study to measure readability and understandability of four different conditions: two different sparkline chart types (bar and line charts) and two text languages (native and non-native languages). We found out that most participants out of 296 in total were not distracted by sparklines. Only 3.19% of the average reading time was spent looking at sparklines. There was no correlation between dwell time and data understanding, measured in a post-experiment quiz. The chart types did not have a significant effect on sparkline attention. However, compared with native textual context, sparklines in non-native text were more noticeable. The results of this study can be useful for future sparkline usage consideration.",,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llvo7AQeWMEPYAnaUIgJlQefZ9yns2iQ/view?usp=drive_web,,,,,2018,poster,Halls B+C,Tuesday,Posters,7:00 PM,8:00 PM,
