Lee",https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/05/InfoVis-Crowdsourcing-CGF2018.pdf,"Visualization researchers have been increasingly leveraging crowdsourcing approaches to overcome a number of limitations of controlled laboratory experiments, including small participant sample sizes and narrow demographic backgrounds of study participants. However, as a community, we have little understanding on when, where, and how researchers use crowdsourcing approaches for visualization research. In this paper, we review the use of crowdsourcing for evaluation in visualization research. We analyzed 190 crowdsourcing experiments, reported in 82 papers that were published in major visualization conferences and journals between 2006 and 2017. We tagged each experiment along 36 dimensions that we identified for crowdsourcing experiments. We grouped our dimensions into six important aspects: study design & procedure, task type, participants, measures & metrics, quality assurance, and reproducibility. We report on the main findings of our review and discuss challenges and opportunities for improvements in conducting crowdsourcing studies for visualization research.",,https://crowdsourcing4vis.github.io/,,,,,2018,star,Room 3+4,Tuesday,STAR I: Human Factors and Evaluation,4:30 PM,5:20 PM,

Cook",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cgf.13264,"Real-world systems change continuously. In domains such as traffic monitoring or cyber security, such changes occur within short time scales. This results in a streaming data problem and leads to unique challenges for the human in the loop, as analysts have to ingest and make sense of dynamic patterns in real time. While visualizations are being increasingly used by analysts to derive insights from streaming data, we lack a thorough characterization of the human-centred design problems and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions that exist for addressing these problems. In this paper, our goal is to fill this gap by studying how the state of the art in streaming data visualization handles the challenges and reflect on the gaps and opportunities. To this end, we have three contributions in this paper: (i) problem characterization for identifying domain-specific goals and challenges for handling streaming data, (ii) a survey and analysis of the state of the art in streaming data visualization research with a focus on how visualization design meets challenges specific to change perception and (iii) reflections on the design trade-offs, and an outline of potential research directions for addressing the gaps in the state of the art.",,,,,10.1111/cgf.13264,2017,2018,star,Room 3+4,Tuesday,STAR I: Human Factors and Evaluation,5:20 PM,6:10 PM,

Janiga, H.-C. Hege, S. Zachow, B. Preim",,"Simulations and measurements of blood and air flow inside the human circulatory and respiratory system play an increasingly important role in personalized medicine for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. This survey focuses on three main application areas. (1) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow in cerebral aneurysms assist in predicting the outcome of this pathologic process and of therapeutic interventions. (2) CFD simulations of nasal airflow allow for investigating the effects of obstructions and deformities and provide therapy decision support. (3) 4D Phase-Contrast (4D PC) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of aortic hemodynamics supports the diagnosis of various vascular and valve pathologies as well as their treatment. An investigation of the complex and often dynamic simulation and measurement data requires the coupling of sophisticated visualization, interaction, and data analysis techniques. In this paper, we survey the large body of work that has been conducted within this realm. We extend previous surveys by incorporating nasal airflow, addressing the joint investigation of blood flow and vessel wall properties, and providing a more fine-granular taxonomy of the existing techniques. From the survey, we extract major research trends and identify open problems and future challenges. The survey is intended for researchers interested in medical flow but also more general, in the combined visualization of physiology and anatomy, the extraction of features from flow field data and feature-based visualization, the visual comparison of different simulation results, and the interactive visual analysis of the flow field and derived characteristics.",,,,,10.1111/cgf.13394,2018,2018,star,Room 3+4,Wednesday,STAR II: FlowVis,11:10 AM,12:00 PM,

Theisel",https://cgl.ethz.ch/disclaimer.php?dlurl=/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2018/Gun18a/Gun18a.pdf,"Vortices are commonly understood as rotating motions in fluid flows. The analysis of vortices plays an important role in numerous scientific applications, such as in engineering, meteorology, oceanology, medicine and many more. The successful analysis consists of three steps: vortex definition, extraction and visualization. All three have a long history, and the early themes and topics from the 70s survived to this day, namely the identification of vortex cores, their extent and the choice of suitable reference frames. This paper provides an overview over the advances that have been made in the last forty years. We provide sufficient background on differential vector field calculus, extraction techniques like critical point search and the parallel vectors operator, and we introduce the notion of reference frame invariance. We explain the most important region-based and line-based methods, integration-based and geometry-based approaches, recent objective techniques, the selection of reference frames by means of flow decompositions, as well as a recent local optimization-based technique. We point out relationships between the various approaches, classify the literature and identify open problems and challenges for future work.",,,,,10.1111/cgf.13319,2018,2018,star,Room 3+4,Wednesday,STAR II: FlowVis,12:00 PM,12:50 PM,

A common visualization approach is to facilitate parameterization techniques which flatten a usually 3D object into a 2D plane. Within this state of the art report (STAR), we review such techniques used in medical visualization and investigate how they can be classified with respect to the handled data and the underlying tasks. Many of these techniques are inspired by mesh parameterization algorithms which help to project a triangulation in R^3 to a simpler domain in R^2. It is often claimed that this makes complex structures easier to understand and compare by humans and machines. Within this STAR we review such flattening techniques which have been developed for the analysis of the following medical entities: the circulation system, the colon, the brain, tumors, and bones. For each of these five application scenarios, we have analyzed the tasks and requirements, and classified the reviewed techniques with respect to a developed coding system. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the future development of flattening techniques in these areas",,,,,,,2018,star,Room 3+4,Wednesday,"STAR III: Visualizing 3D Objects

Using the three‐dimensional (3D) structure of a given protein (i.e. atom types and their locations in 3D) as retrieved from a PDB (Protein Data Bank) file, it is now computationally viable to determine a description of these cavities. Such cavities correspond to pockets, clefts, invaginations, voids, tunnels, channels and grooves on the surface of a given protein. In this work, we survey the literature on protein cavity computation and classify algorithmic approaches into three categories: evolution‐based, energy‐based and geometry‐based. Our survey focuses on geometric algorithms, whose taxonomy is extended to include not only sphere‐, grid‐ and tessellation‐based methods, but also surface‐based, hybrid geometric, consensus and time‐varying methods. Finally, we detail those techniques that have been customized for GPU (graphics processing unit) computing.

Childs",,"Data reduction is increasingly being applied to scientific data for numerical simulations, scientific visualizations and data analyses. It is most often used to lower I/O and storage costs, and sometimes to lower in‐memory data size as well. With this paper, we consider five categories of data reduction techniques based on their information loss: (1) truly lossless, (2) near lossless, (3) lossy, (4) mesh reduction and (5) derived representations. We then survey available techniques in each of these categories, summarize their properties from a practical point of view and discuss relative merits within a category.

The exponentially-growing body of visualization research based on sports data is a prime indication of the importance and timeliness of this report. Sports data visualization research encompasses the breadth of visualization tasks and goals: exploring the design of new visualization techniques; adapting existing visualizations to a novel domain; and conducting design studies and evaluations in close collaboration with experts, including practitioners, enthusiasts, and journalists. Frequently this research has impact beyond sports in both academia and in industry because it is i) grounded in realistic, highly heterogeneous data, ii) applied to real-world problems, and iii) designed in close collaboration with domain experts. In this report, we analyze current research contributions through the lens of three categories of sports data: box score data (data containing statistical summaries of a sport event such as a game), tracking data (data about in-game actions and trajectories), and meta-data (data about the sport and its participants but not necessarily a given game). We conclude this report with a high-level discussion of sports visualization research informed by our analysis—identifying critical research gaps and valuable opportunities for the visualization community.

Where these events semantically form start and end events, they can be combined into interval events. For visual event analytics, the analysis of interval events is more complex than that of point events, since not only the order of events, but also temporal overlaps have to be taken into account. To address this increased complexity and for the purpose of system understanding and analysis, we present SELE, a domain-independent tool for visualizing parallel interval events. SELE is intended to be used on a single long trace of events. A visual technique named strata timeline is developed to handle visual scalability issues. Finally, a multi-core parallel graph searching algorithm is analyzed to demonstrate SELE.",,,,,,,2018,short,Hall D,Wednesday,SP II: Visual Analytics and Applications,11:10 AM,11:30 AM,

Twenty-three participants, in a lab study, were shown two interactive financial portfolio optimization interfaces which allowed them to adjust the return for the portfolio and view how the risk changes. One interface showed the sensitivity of the risk to changes in the return and one did not have this feature. Our study highlights two classes of users. One which preferred the interface with the sensitivity feature and one group that does not prefer the sensitivity feature. We named these two groups the ``risk fixers'' and the ``sweet spotters'' due to the analysis method they used. The ``risk fixers'' selected a level of risk which they were comfortable with while the ``sweet spotters'' tried to find a point right before the risk increased greatly. Our study shows that exposing the sensitivity of investment parameters will impact the investment decision process and increase confidence for these ``sweet spotters.''

In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group-by’s at multiple temporal hierarchies. Effective visual analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP cube-based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space-efficient cube data structures allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re-computed whenever there is new data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise Profiler, a web-based visualization framework that supports the analysis of noise from cities.

Visual-interactive labeling (VIAL) provides users an active role in the process of labeling, with the goal to combine the potentials of humans and machines to make labeling more efficient. Recent experiments showed that users apply different strategies when selecting instances for labeling with visual-interactive interfaces. In this paper, we contribute a systematic quantitative analysis of such user strategies. We identify computational building blocks of user strategies, formalize them, and investigate their potentials for different machine learning tasks in systematic experiments. The core insights of our experiments are as follows. First, we identified that particular user strategies can be used to considerably mitigate the bootstrap (cold start) problem in early labeling phases. Second, we observed that they have the potential to outperform existing active learning strategies in later phases. Third, we analyzed the identified core building blocks, which can serve as the basis for novel selection strategies. Overall, we observed that data-based user strategies (clusters, dense areas) work considerably well in early phases, while model-based user strategies (e.g., class separation) perform better during later phases. The insights gained from this work can be applied to develop novel active learning approaches as well as to better guide users in visual interactive labeling.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Tuesday,FP III: High-dimensional Data,5:20 PM,5:45 PM,

In this paper, we codify summarization use in existing systems to identify key factors in the design of summary visualizations. We use quantitative content analysis to systematically survey examples of visual analytics systems and enumerate the use of these design factors in data summarization. Through this analysis, we expose the relationship between design considerations, strategies for data summarization in visualization systems, and how different summarization methods influence the analyses supported by systems.

To better assess these effects and create refined rankings of visual encodings, we conduct an experiment measuring subject performance across task types (e.g., comparing individual versus aggregate values) and data distributions (e.g., with varied cardinalities and entropies). We compare performance across 12 encoding specifications of trivariate data involving 1 categorical and 2 quantitative fields, including the use of x, y, color, size, and spatial subdivision (i.e., faceting). Our results extend existing models of encoding effectiveness and suggest improved approaches for automated design.

While graph layout algorithms have focused on minimizing edge crossing, symmetry, and other such layout properties, there is not much known about how these algorithms relate to a user’s ability to perceive graph properties for a given graph layout. In this study, we apply previously established methodologies for perceptual analysis to identify which graph drawing layout will help the user best perceive a particular graph property. We conduct a large scale (n = 588 ) crowdsourced experiment to investigate whether the perception of two graph properties (graph density and average local clustering coefficient) can be modeled using Weber’s law. We study three graph layout algorithms from three representative classes (Force Directed - FD, Circular, and Multi-Dimensional Scaling - MDS), and the results of this experiment establish the precision of judgment for these graph layouts and properties. Our findings demonstrate that the perception of graph density can be modeled with Weber’s law. Furthermore, the perception of the average clustering coefficient can be modeled as an inverse of Weber’s law, and the MDS layout showed a significantly different precision of judgment than the FD layout.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Wednesday,FP IV: Visualization Design,10:15 AM,10:40 AM,

From an extensive literature study, we find that the existing solutions suffer from at least one of the drawbacks below: (i) loss of interesting structures/outliers due to sampling; (ii) supporting heatmaps only, which provides limited information; and (iii) no notion of real-world geography semantics (e.g., country, state, city) is captured in the visualization result as well as the underlying index. Therefore, we propose ConcaveCubes, a cluster-based data cube to support interactive visualization of large-scale multidimensional urban data. Specifically, we devise an appropriate visualization abstraction and visualization design based on clusters. We propose a novel concave hull construction method to support boundary based cluster map vi-sualization, where real-world geographical semantics are preserved without any information loss. Instead of calculating the clusters on demand, ConcaveCubes (re)utilizes existing calculation and visualization results to efficiently support different kinds of user interactions. We conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets and show the efficiency and effectiveness of ConcaveCubes by comparing with the state-of-the-art cube-based solutions.

In our case, we developed an algorithm to slice a simplical mesh of any number of dimensions with a two-dimensional slice. In order to get a global appreciation of the multi-dimensional object, we show multiple slices by sampling a number of different slicing points and projecting the slices into a single view per dimension pair. These slices are shown in an interactive viewer which can switch between a global view (all slices) and a local view (single slice).

Thiagarajan, Shusen Liu, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Peer-Timo Bremer",https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07106?context=cs,"Two-dimensional embeddings remain the dominant approach to visualize high dimensional data. The choice of embeddings ranges from highly non-linear ones, which can capture complex relationships but are difficult to interpret quantitatively, to axis-aligned projections, which are easy to interpret but are limited to bivariate relationships. Linear project can be considered as a compromise between complexity and interpretability, as they allow explicit axes labels, yet provide significantly more degrees of freedom compared to axis-aligned projections. Nevertheless, interpreting the axes directions, which are linear combinations often with many non-trivial components, remains difficult. To address this problem we introduce a structure aware decomposition of (multiple) linear projections into sparse sets of axis aligned projections, which jointly capture all information of the original linear ones. In particular, we use tools from Dempster-Shafer theory to formally define how relevant a given axis aligned project is to explain the neighborhood relations displayed in some linear projection. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to discover a diverse set of high quality linear projections and show that in practice the information of k linear projections is often jointly encoded in \sim k axis aligned plots. We have integrated these ideas into an interactive visualization system that allows users to jointly browse both linear projections and their axis aligned representatives. Using a number of case studies we show how the resulting plots lead to more intuitive visualizations and new insight. ",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Wednesday,FP VI: Structure and Shape,12:00 PM,12:25 PM,

In turbulent combustion research, the behavior of the flame surface contains important information about the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The extraction and tracking of this surface is crucial for understanding combustion processes. This is impossible to realize as a post-process because of the size of the involved datasets, which are too large to be stored on disk. We present an on-the-fly method for tracking the flame surface directly during simulation and computing the local tangential surface deformation for arbitrary time intervals. In a massively parallel simulation, the data is distributed over many processes and only a single time step is in memory at any time. To satisfy the demands on parallelism and accuracy posed by this situation, we track the surface with independent micro-patches and adapt their distribution as needed to maintain numerical stability.

Applications range from components in natural language processing systems to tools for linguistic analysis in the study of language and literature. In many of these applications, interpreting embeddings and understanding the encoded grammatical and semantic relations between words is useful, but challenging. Visualization can aid in such interpretation of embeddings. In this paper, we examine the role for visualization in working with word vector embeddings. We provide a literature survey to catalogue the range of tasks where the embeddings are employed across a broad range of applications.

Motivated by such an observation and directly considering pixel coordinates in an embedding optimization process, we accelerate Barnes-Hut tree-based t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (BH-SNE), known as a state-of-the-art 2D embedding method, and propose a novel method called PixelSNE, a highly-efficient, screen resolution-driven 2D embedding method with a linear computational complexity in terms of the number of data items.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

Vortex core lines in vector fields were defined by Sujudi and Haimes to be the locations where stream lines are parallel to an eigenvector of the Jacobian. We show that a similar criterion applied to the eigenvector trajectories of a tensor field yields structurally stable lines that we call tensor core lines . We provide a formal definition of these structures and examine their mathematical properties. We also present a numerical algorithm for extracting tensor core lines in piecewise linear tensor fields.

To detect activities, data scientists iteratively experiment with different classifiers before deciding which model to deploy. Effective reasoning about and comparison of alternative classifiers are crucial in successful model development. This is, however, inherently difficult in developing classifiers for sensor data, where the intricacy of long temporal sequences, high prediction frequency, and imprecise labeling make standard evaluation methods relatively ineffective and even misleading. We introduce Track Xplorer, an interactive visualization system to query, analyze, and compare the predictions of sensor-data classifiers.

In this work, we implement and evaluate an alternative data exploration metaphor where the user remains seated and viewpoint change is only realisable through physical movements. All manipulation is done directly by natural mid-air gestures, with the data being rendered at arm’s reach.

Results are also contrasted to a previous experiment employing artificial flying navigation, with significant observed improvements.

For distance comparison exocentric globe is more accurate than egocentric globe and flat map. For area comparison  more time is required with exocen- tric and egocentric globes than with flat and curved maps. For direction estimation, the exocentric globe is more accurate and faster than the other visual presentations. Our study participants had a weak preference for the exocentric globe.

Our system retrieves GIS relevant to creating a physical model of a geospatial region and then addresses the two major limitations of affordable 3D printers, namely the limited number of materials and available printing volume. This is accomplished by separating features into distinct extruded layers and splitting large models into smaller pieces, allowing us to employs different methods for the visualization of different geospatial features, like vegetation and residential areas, in a 3D printing context.

A CFG is a directed graph representing possible execution paths in a program. CFGs are commonly visualized as node-link diagrams while traces are commonly viewed in raw text format. Visualizing and exploring CFGs and traces is challenging because of the complexity and specificity of the operations researchers perform. We present a design study where we collaborate with computer scientists researching dynamic binary analysis and compilation techniques. The research group primarily employs CFGs and traces to reason about and develop new algorithms for program optimization and parallelization. Through questionnaires, interviews, and a year-long observation, we analyzed their use of visualization, noting that the tasks they perform match common subroutines they employ in their techniques. Based on this task analysis, we designed CFGExplorer, a visual analytics system that supports computer scientists with interactions that are integrated with the program structure. We developed a domain-specific graph modification to generate graph layouts that reflect program structure. CFGExplorer incorporates structures such as functions and loops, and uses the correspondence between CFGs and traces to support navigation. We further augment the system to highlight the output of program analysis techniques, facilitating exploration at a higher level.

In order to manage investment risk, in-depth analysis of changing correlations is needed, with  both  high  and  low  correlations  between  financial  assets  (and  groups  thereof)  important  to  identify.  In  this  paper,  we propose a visual analytics framework for the interactive analysis of relations and structures in dynamic, high-dimensional correlation data. We conduct a series of interviews and review the financial correlation analysis literature to guide our design. Our solution combines concepts from multi-dimensional scaling, weighted complete graphs and threshold networks to present interactive,  animated  displays  which  use  proximity  as  a  visual  metaphor  for  correlation  and  animation  stability  to  encode correlation stability. We devise interaction techniques coupled with context-sensitive auxiliary views to support the analysis of subsets of correlation networks. As part of our contribution, we also present behaviour profiles to help guide future users of our approach. We evaluate our approach by checking the validity of the layouts produced, presenting a number of analysis stories, and through a user study. We observe that our solutions help unravel complex behaviours and resonate well with study participants in addressing their needs in the context of correlation analysis in finance.",,http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/cagatay.turkay.1/Resources/Papers/2018_EuroVis/hunting-high-low-supportingMaterial.pdf,,video http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/cagatay.turkay.1/Resources/Papers/2018_EuroVis/EuroVis2018_HuntingHighLow_v2.mp4,,,2018,full,Hall D,Thursday,FP XII: Applications,11:35 AM,12:00 PM,

Full Papers,,Pondering the Concept of Abstraction in (Illustrative) Visualization,"Ivan Viola, Tobias Isenberg",https://tobias.isenberg.cc/personal/papers/Viola_2018_PCA.pdf,"We explore the concept of abstraction as it is used in visualization, with the ultimate goal of understanding and formally defining it. Researchers so far have used the concept of abstraction largely by intuition without a precise meaning. This lack of specificity left questions on the characteristics of abstraction, its variants, its control, or its ultimate potential for visualization and, in particular, illustrative visualization mostly unanswered. In this paper we thus provide a first formalization of the abstraction concept and discuss how this formalization affects the application of abstraction in a variety of visualization scenarios. Based on this discussion, we derive a number of open questions still waiting to be answered, thus formulating a research agenda for the use of abstraction for the visual representation and exploration of data. This paper, therefore, is intended to provide a contribution to the discussion of the theoretical foundations of our field, rather than attempting to provide a completed and final theory",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Thursday,FP XIII: Scalar Fields,3:35 PM,4:10 PM,
Full Papers,,SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout,"Jane Hoffswell, Alan Borning, Jeffrey Heer",https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jhoffs/website/resources/papers/2018-SetCoLa-EuroVis.pdf,"Constraints enable flexible graph layout by combining the ease of automatic layout with customizations for a particular domain. However, constraint-based layout often requires many individual constraints defined over specific nodes and node pairs. In addition to the effort of writing and maintaining a large number of similar constraints, such constraints are specific to the particular graph and thus cannot generalize to other graphs in the same domain. To facilitate the specification of customized and generalizable constraint layouts, we contribute SetCoLa: a domain-specific language for specifying high-level constraints relative to properties of the backing data. Users identify node sets based on data or graph properties and apply high-level constraints within each set. Applying constraints to node sets rather than individual nodes reduces specification effort and facilitates reapplication of customized layouts across distinct graphs. We demonstrate the conciseness, generalizability, and expressiveness of SetCoLa on a series of real-world examples from ecological networks, biological systems, and social networks.",https://github.com/uwdata/setcola,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Thursday,FP XIV: Trees and Graphs,4:30 PM,4:55 PM,

Lelieveldt, Elmar Eisemann, Anna Vilanova",https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01787046/document,"A bipartite graph is a powerful abstraction for modeling relationships between two collections. Visualizations of bipartite graphs allow users to understand the mutual relationships between the elements in the two collections, e.g., by identifying clusters of similarly connected elements. However, commonly-used visual representations do not scale for the analysis of large bipartite graphs containing tens of millions of vertices, often resorting to an a-priori clustering of the sets. To address this issue, we present the Who’s-Active-On-What-Visualization (WAOW-Vis) that allows for multiscale exploration of a bipartite social-network without imposing an a-priori clustering. To this end, we propose to treat a bipartite graph as a high-dimensional space and we create the WAOW-Vis adapting the multiscale dimensionality-reduction technique HSNE. The application of HSNE for bipartite graph requires several modifications that form the contributions of this work. Given the nature of the problem, a set-based similarity is proposed. For efficient and scalable computations, we use compressed bitmaps to represent sets and we present a novel space partitioning tree to efficiently compute similarities; the Sets Intersection Tree. Finally, we validate WAOW-Vis on several datasets connecting Twitter-users and -streams in different domains: news, computer science and politics. We show how WAOW-Vis is particularly effective in identifying hierarchies of communities AMong social-media users.",,https://github.com/Nicola17/High-Dimensional-Inspector,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Thursday,FP XIV: Trees and Graphs,4:55 PM,5:20 PM,

Given a network topology, it is critical to understand how different applications, job placements, routing  schemes,  etc.,  are  affected  by  and  contribute  to  network  congestion,  especially  for  large  and  complex  networks. Understanding and optimizing communication on large-scale networks is an active area of research. Domain experts often use exploratory tools to develop both intuitive and formal metrics for network health and performance. This paper presents T REE S COPE ,  an  interactive,  web-based  visualization  tool  for  exploring  network  traffic  on  large-scale  fat-tree  networks. T REE S COPE encodes the network topology using a tailored matrix-based representation and provides detailed visualization of  all  traffic  in  the  network.  We  report  on  the  design  process  of T REE S COPE ,  which  has  been  received  positively  by network researchers as well as system administrators. Through case studies of real and simulated data, we demonstrate how T REE S COPE ’s  visual  design  and  interactive  support  for  complex  queries  on  network  traffic  can  provide  experts  with  new insights into the occurrences and causes of congestion in the network.",,,,,,,2018,full,Hall A,Thursday,FP XIV: Trees and Graphs,5:20 PM,5:45 PM,

We conducted an eye-tracking study to measure readability and understandability of four different conditions: two different sparkline chart types (bar and line charts) and two text languages (native and non-native languages). We found out that most participants out of 296 in total were not distracted by sparklines. Only 3.19% of the average reading time was spent looking at sparklines. There was no correlation between dwell time and data understanding, measured in a post-experiment quiz. The chart types did not have a significant effect on sparkline attention. However, compared with native textual context, sparklines in non-native text were more noticeable. The results of this study can be useful for future sparkline usage consideration.",,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llvo7AQeWMEPYAnaUIgJlQefZ9yns2iQ/view?usp=drive_web,,,,,2018,poster,Halls B+C,Tuesday,Posters,7:00 PM,8:00 PM,
