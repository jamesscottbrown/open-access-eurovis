Beliv,Beliv,Towards Designing Unbiased Replication Studies in Information Visualization,,"Poorna Talkad Sukumar, Ronald Metoyer",https://osf.io/q38pg,"Experimenter bias and expectancy effects have been well studied in the social sciences and even in human-computer interaction. They refer to the nonideal study-design choices made by experimenters which can unfairly influence the outcomes of their studies. While these biases need to be considered when designing any empirical study, they can be particularly significant in the context of replication studies which can stray from the studies being replicated in only a few admissible ways. Although there are general guidelines for making valid, unbiased choices in each of the several steps in experimental design, making such choices when conducting replication studies has not been well explored. We reviewed 16 replication studies in information visualization published in four top venues between 2008 to present to characterize how the study designs of the replication studies differed from those of the studies they replicated. We present our characterization categories which include the prevalence of crowdsourcing, and the commonly-found replication types and study-design differences. We draw guidelines based on these categories towards helping researchers make meaningful and unbiased decisions when designing replication studies. Our paper presents the first steps in gaining a larger understanding of this topic and contributes to the ongoing efforts of encouraging researchers to conduct and publish more replication studies in information visualization.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Mini-tutorials,21-Oct,10:00 AM,10:20 AM
Beliv,Beliv,Skipping the Replication Crisis in Visualization: Threats to Study Validity and How to Address Them,,"Robert Kosara, Steve Haroz",https://osf.io/f8qey,"Replications are rare in visualization research, but if they were more common, it is not unreasonable to believe that they would show a similar rate of unreproducible results as in the psychological and social sciences. While a replication crisis in visualization research would be a helpful wake-up call, examining and correcting the underlying problems in many studies is ultimately more productive. In this paper, we survey the state of replication in visualization research. We examine six threats to the validity of studies in visualization and suggest ways to address them. Finally, we describe possible models for publishing replications that satisfy the novelty criterion that can keep replications from being accepted.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Mini-tutorials,21-Oct,10:20 AM,10:40 AM
Beliv,Beliv,Open Practices in Visualization Research,,Steve Haroz,https://osf.io/8ag3w,"Two fundamental tenants of scientific research are that it can be scrutinized and built-upon. Both require that the collected data and supporting materials be shared, so others can examine, reuse, and extend them. Assessing the accessibility of these components and the paper itself can serve as a proxy for the reliability, replicability, and applicability of a field’s research. In this paper, I describe the current state of openness in visualization research and provide suggestions for authors, reviewers, and editors to improve open practices in the field.

Beliv,Beliv,Requirements for Reproducibility of Research in Situational and Spatio-Temporal Visualization,,"André Calero Valdez, Anne Kathrin Schaar, Julian Romeo Hildebrandt, Martina Ziefle",https://www.calerovaldez.com/pdf/beliv2018.pdf,"Research on spatio-temporal visualization is driven by the development of novel visualization and data aggregation techniques. Yet, only little research is conducted on the systematic evaluation of such visualizations. Evaluation of such technology is often conducted in real-life settings and thus lacks fundamental requirements for laboratory-based replication. Replication requires other researchers to independently conduct their own experiments to verify your results. In this position paper, we discuss the requirements for replication studies of spatio-temporal visualization systems. These requirements are often impossible to achieve for highly contextual visualizations such as spatio-temporal visualizations. We argue that reproducibility—allowing other researchers to validate your findings from your data—is a better aim for highly contextual visualiza- tions. We provide a sample workflow to ensure reproducibility for spatio-temporal visualization and discuss its implications.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Panel - A Roadmap For Replication in Visualization,21-Oct,11:10 AM,11:20 AM

Our aim is to overcome some of the limitations of the qualitative methods that are typically used for requirements analysis. When applied alone, methods like interviews fall short in identifying the full set of functionalities that a visualization system should support. We present a five-stage pipeline to structure user task elicitation and analysis around well-established taxonomic dimensions, and make the following contributions: (i) criteria for selecting dimensions from the large body of task taxonomies in the literature, (ii) use of three particular dimensions (granularity, type cardinality and target) to create materials for a requirements analysis workshop with domain experts, (iii) a method for characterizing the task space that was produced by the experts in the workshop, (iv) a decision tree that partitions that space and maps it to visualization design alternatives, and (v) validating our approach by testing the decision tree against new tasks that were collected through interviews with further domain experts.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Papers and Breakout Groups 1,21-Oct,2:30 PM,2:35 PM
Beliv,Beliv,How to evaluate an evaluation study? Comparing and contrasting practices in vis with those of other disciplines,,"Anamaria Crisan, Madison Elliott",https://amcrisan.github.io/assets/files/papers/beliv-2018.pdf,"Evaluative practices within vis research are not routinely compared to those of psychology, sociology, or ther areas of empirical study, leaving vis vulnerable to the replicability crisis that has embroiled scientific research more generally. In this position paper, we compare contemporary vis evaluative practices against those in those other disciplines, and make concrete recommendations as to how vis evaluative practice can be improved through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods. We summarize our discussion and recommendations as a checklist, that we intend to be used a resource for vis researchers conducting evaluative studies, and for reviewers evaluating the merits of such studies.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Papers and Breakout Groups 1,21-Oct,2:35 PM,2:40 PM
Beliv,Beliv,The Garden of Forking Paths in Visualization: A Design Space for Reliable Exploratory Visual Analytics,,"Xiaoying Pu, Matthew Kay",http://www.mjskay.com/papers/beliv2018-forking-paths-in-vis.pdf,"Tukey emphasized decades ago that taking exploratory findings as confirmatory is “destructively foolish”. We reframe recent conversations about the reliability of results from exploratory visual analytics—such as the multiple comparisons problem—in terms of Gelman and Loken’s garden of forking paths to lay out a design space for addressing the forking paths problem in visual analytics. This design space encompasses existing approaches to address the forking paths problem (multiple comparison correction) as well as solutions that have not been applied to exploratory visual analytics (regularization). We also discuss how perceptual bias correction techniques may be used to correct biases induced in analysts’ understanding of their data due to the forking paths problem, and outline how this problem can be cast as a threat to validity within Munzner’s Nested Model of visualization design. Finally, we suggest paper review guidelines to encourage reviewers to consider the forking paths problem when evaluating future designs of visual analytics tools.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Papers and Breakout Groups 1,21-Oct,2:40 PM,2:45 PM

Beliv,Beliv,A case for cognitive models in visualization research,,Lace M. K. Padilla,http://lacepadilla.com/Downloads/publications/Padilla_2018_Preprint.pdf,"The visualization community has seen a rise in the adoption of user studies. Empirical user studies systematically test the assumptions that we make about how visualizations can help or hinder viewers’ performance of tasks. Although the increase in user studies is encouraging, it is vital that research on human reasoning with visualizations be grounded in an understanding of how the mind functions. Previously, there were no sufficient models that illustrate the process of decision-making with visualizations. However, Padilla et al. [41] recently proposed an integrative model for decision-making with visualizations, which expands on modern theories of visualization cognition and decision-making. In this paper, we provide insights into how cognitive models can accelerate innovation, improve validity, and facilitate replication efforts, which have yet to be thoroughly discussed in the visualization community. To do this, we offer a compact overview of the cognitive science of decision-making with visualizations for the visualization community, using the Padilla et al. [41] cognitive model as a guiding framework. By detailing examples of visualization research that illustrate each component of the model, this paper offers novel insights into how visualization researchers can utilize a cognitive framework to guide their user studies. We provide practical examples of each component of the model from empirical studies of visualizations, along with visualization implications of each cognitive process, which have not been directly addressed in prior work. Finally, this work offers a case study in utilizing an understanding of human cognition to generate a novel solution to a visualization reasoning bias in the context of hurricane forecast track visualizations.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Papers and Breakout Groups 2,21-Oct,4:25 PM,4:30 PM
Beliv,Beliv,Heuristic Evaluation in Visualization: an empirical study - Position paper,,"Beatriz Sousa Santos, Samuel Silva, Paulo Dias",http://sweet.ua.pt/bss/papers/HE-empirical%20study-BELIV18_2.pdf,"Heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method that has been adapted to evaluate visualization applications through the development of specific sets of heuristics. This paper presents an empirical study meant to assess the capacity of the method to anticipate the usability issues noticed by users when using a visualization application. The potential usability problems identified by 20 evaluators were compared with the issues found for the same application by 46 users through a usability test, as well as with the fixes recommended by the experimenters observing those users during the test. Results suggest that using some heuristics may have elicited potential problems that none of the users noticed while using the application; on the other hand, users encountered unpredicted usability issues.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Papers and Breakout Groups 2,21-Oct,4:30 PM,4:35 PM

We reflect on our own experiences in evaluating the visualization authoring systems that we have developed as well as the evaluation methods used in other recent projects. We also examine alternative approaches for evaluating visualization authoring systems that we believe to be more appropriate than traditional comparative studies. We hope that our discussion is informative, not only for researchers who intend to develop novel visualization authoring systems, but also for reviewers assigned to evaluate the research contributions of these systems. Our discussion concludes with opportunities for facilitating the evaluation and adoption of deployed visualization authoring systems.",,,,,,not yet submitted to crossref,2018,2018,Beliv,"Hall 1, Section C",Sunday,Papers and Breakout Groups 2,21-Oct,4:35 PM,4:40 PM

Although, this is a fully automated process it has many security issues. IP hijacks and misconfigurations occur very often and are difficult to detect. In the past visual analytics approaches aimed at detecting these phenomenons but only a few of these integrated geographical references. Geo-IP data is being used mostly as a lookup table which is an undervaluation of its capabilities. In this paper we present a visual-interactive system which only relies on Geo-IP data to create more awareness for this data source. We show that looking at Geo-IP data over time in combination with owner and location information of IP blocks already reveals suspicious cases. Together with our design study we also contribute a pre-processing algorithm for the Maxmind GeoIP2 City and ISP databases, to motivate the community to integrate this data source in future approaches.",http://crisp.igd.fraunhofer.de/,,,,,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Networks and Privacy,22-Oct,11:00 AM,11:25 AM
VizSec,VizSec,Looking for a Black Cat in a Dark Room: Security Visualization for Cyber-Physical System Design and Analysis,,"Georgios Bakirtzis, Brandon James Simon, Cody H Fleming, Carl R. Elks",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08081.pdf,"Today, there is a plethora of software security tools employing visualizations that enable the creation of useful and effective interactive security analyst dashboards. Such dashboards can assist the analyst to understand the data at hand and, consequently, to conceive more targeted preemption and mitigation security strategies. Despite the recent advances, model-based security analysis is lacking tools that employ effective dashboards—to manage potential attack vectors, system components, and requirements. This problem is further exacerbated because model-based security analysis produces significantly larger result spaces than security analysis applied to realized systems—where platform specific information, software versions, and system element dependencies are known. Therefore, there is a need to manage the analysis complexity in model-based security through better visualization techniques. Towards that goal, we propose an interactive security analysis dashboard that provides different views largely centered around the system, its requirements, and its associated attack vector space. This tool makes it possible to start analysis earlier in the system lifecycle. We apply this tool in a significant area of engineering design—the design of cyber-physical systems—where security violations can lead to safety hazards.",,https://github.com/bakirtzisg/security-analyst-dashboard,,,,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Networks and Privacy,22-Oct,11:25 AM,11:50 AM

Understanding the distribution of the queries received by the root DNS, and how those queries change over time, in an intuitive manner is sought. Traditional query analysis is performed packet by packet, lacking global, temporal, and visual coherence, obscuring latent trends and clusters. Our approach leverages the pattern recognition and computational power of deep learning with 2D and 3D rendering techniques for quick and easy interpretation and interaction with vast amount of root DNS network trafc. Working with real-world DNS experts, our visualization reveals several surprising latent clusters of queries, potentially malicious and benign, discovers previously unknown characteristics of a real-world root DNS DDOS attack, and uncovers unforeseen changes in the distribution of queries received over time. These discoveries will provide DNS analysts with a deeper understanding of the nature of the DNS trafc under their charge, which will help them safeguard the root DNS against future attack.",,,,,,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Networks and Privacy,22-Oct,11:50 AM,12:15 PM

Our ultimate goal is to reduce analyst workload by automating the process of decision making for investigating alerts using the machine learning model in cases where we can completely trust the model. This way, SOC analysts will be able to focus their time and effort to investigate more complex cases of security alerts. To achieve this goal, we developed a system that shows the prediction for an alert and the prediction explanation to security analysts during their daily workflow of investigating individual security alerts. Another part of our system presents the aggregated model analytics to the managers and stakeholders to help them understand the model and decide,on when to trust the model and let the model make the final decision. Using our prediction explanation visualization, security analysts will be able to classify oncoming alerts more efficiently and gain insight into how a machine learning model generates predictions. Our model performance analysis dashboard helps decision makers analyze the model in signature level granularity and gain more insights about the model.",,,,,,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Analytics,22-Oct,2:20 PM,2:45 PM

This paper describes a novel algorithm based on Discrete Fourier Transforms capable of detecting multiple distinct period lengths in a given timeseries. We pair the output of this algorithm with aggregation summary tables that give users information scent about which detections are worth investigating based on the metadata of the log events rather than the periodic signal. A visualization of selected detections enables users to see all detected period lengths per entity, and compare detections between entities to check for coordinated activity. We evaluate our approach on real-world netflow and DNS data from a large organization, demonstrating how to successfully find malicious periodic activity in a large pool of noise and non-malicious periodic activity.",,,,,youtube Oisi6PlepTA,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Analytics,22-Oct,2:45 PM,3:10 PM

Understanding dynamic and multi-variate user behavior are challenging. Traditional sequential and timeline based method cannot easily address the complexity of temporal and relational features of user behaviors. We propose a map-based visual metaphor and create an interactive map for encoding user behaviors. It enables analysts to explore and identify user behavior patterns and helps them to understand why some behaviors are regarded as anomalous. We experiment with a real dataset containing multiple user sessions, consisting of sequences of diverse types of actions. In the behavior map, we encode an action as a city and user sessions as trajectories going through the cities. The position of the cities is determined by the sequential and temporal relationship of actions. Spatial and temporal patterns on the map reflect behavior patterns in the action space. In the case study, we illustrate how we explore relationships between actions, identify patterns of the typical session and detect anomaly behaviors.",,,,,,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Short Papers,22-Oct,5:10 PM,5:30 PM

Establishing the veracity of the person or business behind a pseudonomized identity, online, is a challenge for many people. In the burgeoning digital economy, finding ways to support good decision-making in potentially risky online exchanges is of vital importance. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning method to extract temporal patterns from data on individuals’ behavioral norms in their online activity. This monitors and communicates the coherence of these activities to others, especially those who are about to disclose personal information to the individual, in a visualization. We report findings from a user trial that examined how people accessed and interpreted the TAPESTRY visualization to inform their decisions on who to back in a mock crowdfunding campaign to evaluate its efficacy. The study proved the protocol of the Machine Learning method and qualitative insights are informing iterations of the visualization design to enhance user experience and support understanding.",,,,,,,2018,2018,VizSec,"Hall 1, Section C",Monday,Short Papers,22-Oct,5:30 PM,5:50 PM
